#+TITLE: Battleship project

Implementation of the battleship game which has a big room for improvement

** TODOs
*** UI
- New game/Clear board/Player's name inputs
- Improve design
- DONE Input to choose with whom to play (Player or Computer)
- FIXME Creating new game is not possible after creating the first one
   
*** Functionality
- Do not allow to hit already hit cell (this can be misused actually)
- Add not random ships placement
  + allow user to choose random variant both for whole board and particular ship

*** AI
- When hit, don't hit completely random places, but rather some random near
  + "understand" the direction
  + "understand" sunk state
